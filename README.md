# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### **Overview of the Code**
This code provides the implementation of a **Stock Trading System** using **React (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend)**. Below is a structured explanation of each part:

---

### **Frontend (React) - `AddStock.js`**
The **React component** handles:
1. **Stock Addition & Selling** - Allows users to buy and sell stocks.
2. **Setting Price Alerts** - Users can set **BUY/SELL price alerts**.
3. **Fetching Price History** - Retrieves past stock prices from the backend.
4. **Displaying Alerts & Notifications** - Shows active alerts and price history with pagination.

#### **Key Features:**
âœ… **Stock Buying & Selling**
âœ… **User Alerts Management**
âœ… **Loading State & Error Handling**
âœ… **Pagination for Price History**
âœ… **Uses `axios` for API calls**
âœ… **Manages Stock Portfolio**

---

### **Backend (Node.js + Express) - `transactionRoutes.js`**
The backend **handles stock transactions**:
1. **Buy Stocks** - Checks wallet balance before allowing purchase.
2. **Sell Stocks** - Ensures user has enough stock to sell.
3. **Email Notification** - Sends an **email notification** after transactions.
4. **Transaction History API** - Returns all transactions for a user.

#### **Key Features:**
âœ… **MongoDB Database (Mongoose)**
âœ… **Email Notifications using `nodemailer`**
âœ… **User Wallet Balance Management**
âœ… **Transaction History API**
âœ… **Proper Error Handling**

---

### **Enhancements & Suggestions**
ðŸ”¹ **Feature Improvements:**
- Implement **real-time stock price updates** using WebSockets.
- Add **chart visualization** for stock price history.
- Allow users to set **multiple alerts** on a single stock.

ðŸ”¹ **Code Optimizations:**
- Move **API calls to a separate service layer**.
- Optimize **pagination logic** to improve performance.
